  - Neon is a fully-managed PostgreSQL service built on a key-value storage engine with point-to-time recovery support.
  - *Compaction Strategy Enhancement*. Conducted an in-depth analysis and evaluation of the storage engine to assess performance metrics and storage space efficiency. Implemented the RocksDB-style tiered compaction and improved page reconstruction strategy, which reduced space amplification by 2x and enhanced read-update performance by 20%.
 - *Improved User Adoption on the Edge*. Enhanced the overall reliability of the Neon serverless driver and the control plane proxy. Collaborated closely with the #link("https://github.com/prisma/prisma", [Prisma]) ORM team to integrate the serverless driver into Prisma and ensured compatibility with Vercel Edge Runtime by transitioning the Rust Prisma engine codebase to be WebAssembly-ready.

  - *Top contributor of #githublink("https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave", text: "RisingWave")*. RisingWave is a database system with PostgreSQL-compatible interface that incrementally maintains materialized views. Worked on features including streaming index joins, query optimization of stream plans, distributed streaming execution, cloud-native LSM state store, vectorized expression framework.
  - *Streaming Index Joins*:  Designed shared state and streaming index in RisingWave; implemented index lookup join executor; implemented delta join DAG optimizer transformations; implemented distributed delta join scheduler.
  - *Performance Improvement*:  Conducted intensive benchmarks and analyzed performance issues. Fixed bugs, proposed strategies, and led cross-team collaboration which improved the system throughput by 10x in a 3-month period.
  - *Developer Experience*.  Initiated the RiseDev development tool and the developer dashboard, which is deeply integrated into the development workflow across debugging, unit testing, integration testing, and benchmarking.
  - *Mentoring*. Mentored database kernel interns and helped their successful integration into the team. Maintained overview documents of the database kernel to facilitate knowledge transfer and help new hires learn about the system.

TerarkDB is a fork of RocksDB and ZenFS is a filesystem on Zoned Namespaces (ZNS) SSDs. Implemented Zone-aware Garbage Collection in TerarkDB for ZNS and WAL-Aware Zone Allocator in ZenFS, which reduced 3-4x of space amplification and greatly improved tail latencies caused by zone allocation.
